<p>Welcome to the MvCphp Framework.</p>

<p>To get started you might want to read this post on how the whole framework goes
together.</p>

<p>To get started you'll probably want to edit the file AppCore/Settings.php. This
file contains all the framework settings. The ones you'll likely want to mess with
are the follow:</p>

<p class="code">
$USING_REWRITE - if you want SEF URLs and have mod_rewrite turned on.<br />
$DB_USER, $DB_PASS, $DB_NAME, and $DB_HOST for database access. <br />
</p>
